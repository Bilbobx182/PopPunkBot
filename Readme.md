PopPunkBotA bot I use to take Artist and song names from reddit/r/poppunkers and add the top of the week to spotify.
For the python script to work you need the spotify credentials for apps. It'd be unwise for me to leave mine in the code. you also need to have Node.Js installed.

How to run: 
Start the server.js by typing in "Node server.js" into command prompt.
Start the python program, fill in details like CID(Client ID) and CS(Client Secret)(You get these from spotify)
Pid=URI of the playlist you want(I removed mine so people testing wouldn't accidentally add to it)
Run the Python program.It will probably ask you to authenticate yourself.
