V.1.0.1		Added in comments, made the readme on how to use it more clear.
V.1.0.2		Made it so program detects more songs. It also takes in URIs now instead of song names
V.1.0.3		Fixed it so that the program wouldn't break(  as much  ) when dealing with large amounts of songs.
V.1.0.4		Made the readme more helpful. Updated code so it will catch all songs. not just 80. 
V.1.0.5		Added in duplicate checking.
V.1.0.6		Added in code to parse YouTube links when people format their reddit post wrong. Increased amount of songs caught by 7+%
V.1.0.7		Updated code to make it slightly more efficient. Although I do wonder the tradeoff between more songs vs accuracy of songs.
V.1.0.8		Added in another section to post weekly to the sub for a weekly discussion which includes playlist links.
V.1.0.9		Updated readme.
