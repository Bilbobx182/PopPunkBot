# PopPunkBot
A bot I use to take Artist and song names from reddit/r/poppunkers and add the top of the week to spotify.

For the python script to work you need the spotify credentials for apps. It'd be unwise for me to leave mine in the code.
you also need to have Node.Js installed and follow the spotify API tutorial in regards to set up.
